# BrainStation

For my final BrainStation project, I will be looking at the correlation between MVP candidates (NBA) and compare their respective metrics (stats) accordingly. The goal is to be able to draw a correlation and see if the players that got the award actually deserved it. A benchmark will hopefully be drawn and the idea here is to compare the MVPs to all the candidates in their respective years. This project will be divided into the following parts: <br>
    1. Loading the CSV files containing the desired data  <br>
    2. Processing and cleaning the data  <br>
    3. Developing some visuals to help for analysis purposes  <br>
        a. Scatterplot  <br>
        b. Pie Chart  <br>
    4. Create numerical model  <br>
    5. Apply model validation techniques  <br>
    6. Discuess insights <br>
    
    Tech Stack: Python, matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Beautiful Soup , REST API
